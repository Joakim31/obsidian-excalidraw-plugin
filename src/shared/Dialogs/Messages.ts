The Excalidraw Obsidian plugin is much more than "just" a drawing tool. To help you get started here's a showcase of the key Excalidraw plugin features.

If you'd like to learn more, please subscribe to my YouTube channel: [Visual PKM](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC0gns4a9fhVkGkngvSumAQ) where I regularly share videos about Obsidian-Excalidraw and about tools and techniques for Visual Personal Knowledge Management.

Thank you & Enjoy!

## Fixed

- Dynamic styling was not working when frames were present in the scene.
- Minor fix to the screenshot feature. This also resolves the long-standing issue where window control buttons (close, minimize, maximize) appeared in full-screen mode.
- Fixed an issue where ALT/OPT + dragging an embeddable object sometimes failed, resulting in an empty object instead of dragging the element.

## New

- **Line Polygons**: Draw a closed line shape, and it will automatically snap into a polygon. [#9477](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9477)
  - Updated the Split Ellipse and Boolean Operations scripts to support this feature.
  - When entering line editor mode (CTRL/CMD + click), the lock point is now marked for easier editing. You can break the polygon using the polygon action in the elements panel.
- **Popout Override**: The "Open the back-of-the-note for the selected image in a popout window" action now overrides the "Focus on Existing Tab" setting and always opens a new popout.
- **Text Arch Enhancements**: The Text Arch script now supports fitting text to a wider range of paths and shapes. Text can also be edited and refitted to different paths.
- **Improved Unlock UI**: Single-clicking a locked element now shows an unlock button. [#9546](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9546)
- **Script Update Alerts**: On startup, Excalidraw will notify you if any installed scripts have available updates.

"2.11.1": `
## Fixed:
- The new "Screenshot" option in the Export Image dialog was not working properly. [#2339](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2339)

## New from Excalidraw.com
- Quarter snap points for diamonds [#9387](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9387)
- Precise highlights for bindings [#9472](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9472)

`,
"2.11.0": `
## New
- New "Screenshot" option in the Export Image dialog. This allows you to take a screenshot of the current view, including embedded web pages, youtube videos, and markdown documents. Screenshot is only possible in PNG.
- Expose parameter in plugin settings to disable AI functionality [#2325](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2325)
- Enable (disable) double-click text editing option in Excalidraw appearance and behavior (based on request on Discord)
- Added two new PDF export sizes: "Match image", "HD Screen".
- Switch between basic shapes. Quickly change the shape of the selected element by pressing TAB [#9270](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9270)
- Updated the Scribble Helper Script. Now controls are at the top so your palm does accidently trigger them. I added a new button to insert special characters. Scribble helper now makes use of the new text element wrapping in Excalidraw.

## Fixed in the plugin
- Scaling multiple embeddables at once did not work. [#2276](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2276)
- When creating multiple back-of-the-note the second card is not created correctly if autosave has not yet happened.
- Drawing reloads while editing the back-of-the-note card in certain cases causes editing to be interrupted.
- Moved Excalidraw filetype indicator ‚úèÔ∏è to after filename where other filetype tags are displayed. You can turn the filetype indicator on/off in plugin settings under Miscellaneous.

## Fixed by Excalidraw.com
- Alt-duplicate now preserves the original element. Previously, using Alt to duplicate would swap the original with the new element, leading to unexpected behavior and several downstream issues. [#9403](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9403)
- When dragging the arrow endpoint, update the binding only on the dragged side [#9367](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9367)
- Laser pointer trail disappearing on pointerup [#9413](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9413) [#9427](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9427)

## Fixed by Excalidraw.com
- Eraser performance improvement regression. Erasing locked elements. [#9400](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9400)

## New
- Grid Customization Options in plugin settings (appearance and behavior/grid): You can now selectively show or hide vertical and horizontal grid lines independently. This allows you to create alternative grid styles, such as horizontal-only lined grids instead of the traditional checkered pattern.

## Fixed in ExcalidrawAutomate
- ${String.fromCharCode(96)}ea.createSVG${String.fromCharCode(96)} throws error [#2321](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2321)

## New in ExcalidrawAutomate

## Fixed
- PDF export scenario described in [#2184](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2184)
- Elbow arrows do not work within frames [#2187](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2187)
- Embedding images into Excalidraw with areaRef links did not work as expected due to conflicting SVG viewbox and width and height values
- Can't exit full-screen mode in popout windows using the Command Palette toggle action [#2188](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2188)
- If the image mask extended beyond the image in "Mask and Crop" image mode, the mask got misaligned from the image.
- PDF image embedding fixes that impacted some PDF files (not all):
    - When cropping the PDF page in the scene (by double-clicking the image to crop), the size and position of the PDF cutout drifted.
    - Using PDF++ there was a small offset in the position of the cutout in PDF++ and the image in Excalidraw.
 - Updated a number of scripts including Split Ellipse, Select Similar Elements, and Concatenate Lines

</div></div>

## Fixed
- Toggling image size anchoring on and off by modifying the image link did not update the image in the view until the user forced saved it or closed and opened the drawing again. This was a side-effect of the less frequent view save introduced in 2.7.1

## New
- **Shade Master Script**: A new script that allows you to modify the color lightness, hue, saturation, and transparency of selected Excalidraw elements, SVG images, and nested Excalidraw drawings. When a single image is selected, you can map colors individually. The original image remains unchanged, and a mapping table is added under ${String.fromCharCode(96)}## Embedded Files${String.fromCharCode(96)} for SVG and nested drawings. This helps maintain links between drawings while allowing different color themes.
- New Command Palette Command: "Duplicate selected image with a different image ID". Creates a copy of the selected image with a new image ID. This allows you to add multiple color mappings to the same image. In the scene, the image will be treated as if a different image, but loaded from the same file in the Vault.

## QoL Improvements
- New setting under ${String.fromCharCode(96)}Embedding Excalidraw into your notes and Exporting${String.fromCharCode(96)} > ${String.fromCharCode(96)}Image Caching and rendering optimization${String.fromCharCode(96)}. You can now set the number of concurrent workers that render your embedded images. Increasing the number will increase the speed but temporarily reduce the responsiveness of your system in case of large drawings.
- Moved pen-related settings under ${String.fromCharCode(96)}Excalidraw appearance and behavior${String.fromCharCode(96)} to their sub-heading called ${String.fromCharCode(96)}Pen${String.fromCharCode(96)}.
- Minor error fixing and performance optimizations when loading and updating embedded images.
- Color maps in ${String.fromCharCode(96)}## Embedded Files${String.fromCharCode(96)} may now include color keys "stroke" and "fill". If set, these will change the fill and stroke attributes of the SVG root element of the relevant file.

## New in ExcalidrawAutomate

## Fixed
- The plugin did not load on **iOS 16 and older**. [#2170](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2170)
- Added empty line between ${String.fromCharCode(96)}# Excalidraw Data${String.fromCharCode(96)} and ${String.fromCharCode(96)}## Text Elements${String.fromCharCode(96)}. This will now follow **correct markdown linting**. [#2168](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2168)

- **Deconstruct selected elements script** did not copy URLs and URIs for images embedded from outside Obsidian. Please update your script from the script library. 
- When **rearranging tabs in Obsidian**, e.g. having two tabs side by side, and moving one of them to another location, if the tab was an Excalidraw tab, it appeared as non-responsive after the move, until the tab was resized.

## Source Code Refactoring
- Updated filenames, file locations, and file name letter-casing across the project
- Extracted onDrop, onDragover, etc. handlers to DropManger in ExcalidrawView

- Since Electron 32 (newer Obsidian Desktop installers) drag and drop links from Finder or OS File Explorer did not work. [Electron breaking change](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/breaking-changes#removed-filepath). This is now fixed
- Addressed unnecessary image reloads when changing windows in Obsidian
`,
"2.7.0":`
## Fixed
- Various Markdown embeddable "fuzziness":  
    - Fixed issues with appearance settings and edit mode toggling when single-click editing is enabled.  
    - Ensured embeddable file editing no longer gets interrupted unexpectedly.  
- **Hover Preview**: Disabled hover preview for back-of-the-note cards to reduce distractions.
- **Settings Save**: Fixed an issue where plugin settings unnecessarily saved on every startup.

## New Features
- **Image Cropping Snaps to Objects**: When snapping is enabled in the scene, image cropping now aligns to nearby objects.  
- **Session Persistence for Pen Mode**: Excalidraw remembers the last pen mode when switching between drawings within the same session.

## Refactoring
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Excalidraw now uses its own Mermaid package, breaking future dependencies on Obsidian's Mermaid updates. This ensures stability and includes all fixes and improvements made to Excalidraw Mermaid since February 2024. The plugin file size has increased slightly, but this change significantly improves maintainability while remaining invisible to users.  
- **MathJax Optimization**: MathJax (LaTeX equation SVG image generation) now loads only on demand, with the package compressed to minimize the startup and file size impact caused by the inclusion of Mermaid.  
- **On-Demand Language Loading**: Non-English language files are now compressed and load only when needed, counterbalancing the increase in file size due to Mermaid and improving load speeds.  
- **Codebase Restructuring**: Improved type safety by removing many ${String.fromCharCode(96)}//@ts-ignore${String.fromCharCode(96)} commands and enhancing modularity. Introduced new management classes: **CommandManager**, **EventManager**, **PluginFileManager**, **ObserverManager**, and **PackageManager**. Further restructuring is planned for upcoming releases to improve maintainability and stability.

"2.6.8":`
## New
- **QoL improvements**:
  - Obsidian-link search button in Element Link Editor.
  - Add Any File now searches file aliases as well.
  - Cosmetic changes to file search modals (display path, show file type icon).
  - Text Element cursor-color matches the text color.
- New script in script store: [Image Occlusion](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Image%20Occlusion.md) by [@TrillStones](https://github.com/TrillStones) üôè

## Fixed
- Excalidraw icon on the **ribbon menu kept reappearing** every time you reopen Obsidian [#2115](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2115)
- In pen mode, when **single-finger panning** is enabled, Excalidraw should still **allow actions with the mouse**.
- When **editing a drawing in split mode** (drawing is on one side, markdown view is on the other), editing the markdown note sometimes causes the drawing to re-zoom and jump away from the selected area.
- Hover-Editor compatibility resolved [2041](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2041)
-  ${String.fromCharCode(96)}ExcalidrawAutomate.create() ${String.fromCharCode(96)} will now correctly include the markdown text in templates above Excalidraw Data and below YAML front matter. This also fixes the same issue with the **Deconstruct Selected Element script**.
